# Landing-Page
TheOdinProject Landing Page

This is the for the landing page project for The Odin Project. It was definitely a challenge to manage all
the elements in the page using flexbox and css basics. HTML changes were also needed but not too much that 
it was getting convoluted. Overall a decent exercise in learning to create a website all by my own. With the
help of chatGPT and copilot AI I was able to figure out the answers to a lot of my questions.
